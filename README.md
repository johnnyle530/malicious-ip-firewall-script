# macOS IP Blocker ‚Äì Updated Version

This project blocks inbound and outbound network traffic from known malicious IPs using the macOS `pf` firewall. It fetches data from public threat intelligence feeds and automates blocking with logging and optional email alerts.

## üîê Features

- Automatically pulls from:
  - [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
  - [FireHOL Level 1](https://iplists.firehol.org/)
  - [Emerging Threats](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/)
- Blocks both inbound and outbound traffic via `pf`
- Maintains a whitelist (e.g., local IPs, current public IP)
- Logs blocked activity
- Sends email notifications using Gmail SMTP via `msmtp`
- Automatically runs on a schedule with `cron`

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo or copy files locally
Put everything into a folder, e.g., `~/Documents/ip-blocker-project`.

### 2. Make your script executable
```bash
chmod +x block_malicious_ips_UPDATED.sh
```

### 3. Run the script manually
```bash
cd ~/Documents/ip-blocker-project
sudo ./block_malicious_ips_UPDATED.sh
```

This will:
- Create a whitelist with internal IPs and your current public IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.1.25`, `73.202.33.80`)
- Fetch and merge IP threat data
- Write to `blocklist.conf`
- Reload PF firewall

## üß™ Testing PF Rules

### To test configuration:
```bash
sudo pfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf
```

### To apply firewall rules:
```bash
sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
sudo pfctl -e
```

You can configure Gmail app password in `.ipblocker.env` like:

GMAIL_USER='your_email@gmail.com'
GMAIL_PASS='your_app_password'
```

Make sure `msmtp` is installed and configured for sending.

```

Add:
```cron
